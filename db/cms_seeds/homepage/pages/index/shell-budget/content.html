<p>This featured project uses <strong>shell budgets</strong> as a tool in <span class="highlight">Oyster Restoration</span> and <span class="highlight">Fishery Management</span>. Investigators are <strong>Roger Mann</strong> of the <em>Virginia Institute of Marine Science</em>, <strong>Tom Soniat</strong> of the <em>University of New Orleans</em>, <strong>Eric Powell</strong> of the <em>University of Southern Mississippi</em>, <strong>John Klinck</strong> of <em>Old Dominion University</em>, and <strong>Patrick Banks</strong> of the <em>Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries</em>. The objective of the project, funded by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation/ Shell Marine Habitat Program, is to<span class="highlight"> Support Conservation</span> and <span class="highlight">Restoration Of Oyster Reef Habitat</span>. The focus is on <strong>Primary Public Oyster Seed Grounds of the State of Louisiana</strong>. We critically examine the rate functions that drive both the creation of oyster habitat and its loss in a large-scale environmental management application. As such, we provide a critical tool for restoration and maintenance of native oyster populations that insures both maximum productivity and assured longevity of the oyster habitat and the populations it supports. Such a habitat based restoration tool is applicable to oyster restoration projects nationwide.
