      <p><strong>Oyster Sentinel</strong> is a web-based community which uses the eastern oyster, <em>Crassostrea virginica</em>, to monitor the environmental health of estuaries along the Gulf of Mexico. The eastern oyster and its principal parasite <em>Perkinsus marinus</em>, are bio-indicators of mesohaline salinity regimes, and their distributions can be used to evaluate the Freshwater Resources needed to sustain oysters, control parasites and predators, and support other estuarine-dependent organisms. Modeling tools are provided to assess the impact of salinity alterations on oyster habitat, select sites for reef restoration, and estimate sustainable harvests.
