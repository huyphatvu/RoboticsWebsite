Welcome to Oyster Sentinel


[wysiwyg explaination]
<p><strong>Oyster Sentinel</strong> is a web-based community which uses the eastern oyster, <em>Crassostrea virginica</em>, to monitor the environmental health of estuaries along the Gulf of Mexico. The eastern oyster and its principal parasite <em>Perkinsus marinus</em>, are bio-indicators of mesohaline salinity regimes, and their distributions can be used to evaluate the Freshwater Resources needed to sustain oysters, control parasites and predators, and support other estuarine-dependent organisms. Modeling tools are provided to assess the impact of salinity alterations on oyster habitat, select sites for reef restoration, and estimate sustainable harvests.

      The website was established in 2007 by <span class="highlight">Thomas M. Soniat</span> (<a href="mailto:tsoniat@uno.edu">tsoniat@uno.edu</a>) and the late <span class="highlight">Sammy M. Ray</span> to promote the health of estuaries along the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">OUR PROJECT</h1><hr><p>The project spans a full academic year. Students receive basic definitions of a robot and a set of rules for their robots task. They then research parts and compare specifications to insure compatibility. Mechanical students design chassis, actuators and mounting structures for sensors. The sensor committee evaluates the rules and selects appropriate sensors. The electronics committee solders and assembles the motor controller, Parts are procured and after 3D printing of the chassis the robot is assembled and wired. Finally, the teams program and test their designs. They refine as necessary and prepare for competition.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">OUR GOAL</h1><hr><p>The goal of the UNO Robotics club is to encourage student acquisition of knowledge and skills about autonomous robots. Students will design, construct, wire, program, and test their robots in teams. Top teams compete in annual regional competitions. The UNO Robotics club supports the annual program with a wide range of instruction and mentoring by faculty, staff, and experienced students. Main areas of instructions include CAD design, mechanical assembly, drive trains, electrical design and wiring, electronics, sensors, motion programming, navigation, and AI.
